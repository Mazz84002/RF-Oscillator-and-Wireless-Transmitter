Simulations show the functioning of all of the oscillator, matching network and microstrip antenna in producing and transmitting the \(3.5[GHz]\) signal. This has been verified by transient and spectral analysis of the output of the circuit itself and by the simulated pass-band of the microstrip antenna. According to simulations, we were able to obtain good efficiency in oscillator and large enough bandwidth in the antenna to cover the cases of maximum deviation from ideal oscillating frequency, ensuring reliable performance in edge cases as well. \par


Upon delivery of the PCB, the output of the antenna will be detected and spectrally analysed in the RFIC lab. The key parts of this project exemplify three of the most significant building blocks of modern wireless communication systems.
