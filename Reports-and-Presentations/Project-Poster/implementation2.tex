% ================================================ MATCHING =====================================
\textbf{Matching:}
A T-Matching Network was used since it offers more control over the Q factor compared to L-match but with a trade-off of slightly more complex design~\cite{Pozar:882338}. The values of \(L, C\) were approximated to available component values.\par

% ================================================ ANTENA =====================================
\textbf{Antenna:}
Regular microstrip patch antennas generally have a narrow bandwidth. This makes them less suitable for wideband applications. To handle fabrication variations in the oscillating frequency, a different topology consisting of coupled resonators was used~\cite{7592896}. This improves BW by providing two controllable resonances and supression of extra harmonics in the vicinity.\par
